## 2. Technologies and Techniques Used

### Technologies:

- **React.js**: Manages the component-based structure of the front end and handles the user interface.
- **MongoDB & Mongoose**: Handles user and product data in a NoSQL database with schema-based modeling.
- **Express.js & Node.js**: Backend framework and server runtime environment for handling API requests and user authentication.
- **CSS**: Provides a custom, responsive layout with styles suited to a modern fashion brand.

### Techniques:

- **State Management**:

  - **useState** and **useEffect**: Used to manage the dynamic aspects of the shop such as cart contents, user sessions, and product data.

  ```javascript
  const [cartItems, setCartItems] = useState([]);
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);
  const [products, setProducts] = useState([]);
  ```
