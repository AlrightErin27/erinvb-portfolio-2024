# Weather Globe Project Continuation Guide

## Project Overview

An interactive weather application featuring a 3D globe with an overlaid terminal interface. The terminal provides weather information and recommendations based on selected locations.

## Current Progress

- Implemented responsive 3D globe using react-globe.gl
- Created overlaid terminal with glass-effect design
- Established responsive layout for various screen sizes
- Set up initial color scheme and styling

## Current Tech Stack

- React
- react-globe.gl
- Three.js (peer dependency)
- Custom CSS with CSS variables

## Current Component Structure

```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── Forecast.jsx (parent component)
│   ├── Globe.jsx (3D globe visualization)
│   ├── Terminal.jsx (terminal interface)
│   └── Forecast.css (shared styles)
```

## Current Color Palette

```css
:root {
  --blue-space: #000011;
  --polar-white: #f2f3f5;
  --sahara-sand: #f4dcb9;
  --reef-blue: #2b7ee3;
  --egyptian-cream: #ebcc9d;
  --french-oak: #668636;
}
```

## Next Steps

1. Terminal Interface Development:

   - Implement terminal input functionality
   - Add command history
   - Create typing animations
   - Finalize terminal styling

2. Location Search:

   - Integrate geocoding service
   - Add location validation
   - Implement globe animation to location

3. Weather Integration:

   - Choose and integrate weather API
   - Design weather data display
   - Create recommendation system

4. Visual Polish:
   - Add loading states
   - Implement transitions
   - Enhance responsive design
   - Add interactive elements

## Current Challenges/Decisions Needed

1. Terminal theme selection
2. Weather API choice
3. Command structure for terminal
4. Recommendation system approach

## End Goal Features

1. Interactive 3D globe visualization
2. Sleek terminal interface
3. Location-based weather data
4. Intelligent recommendations
5. Smooth animations
6. Responsive design across devices

## Implementation Phase (Current Status: Phase 1)

- ✅ Phase 1: Basic Setup & Globe
- 🔄 Phase 2: Terminal Interface
- ⏳ Phase 3: Location & Weather
- ⏳ Phase 4: Recommendations
- ⏳ Phase 5: Polish & Optimization

## Next Session Focus Points

1. Finalize terminal styling theme
2. Implement basic terminal functionality
3. Begin location search integration

## Questions to Address Next Session

1. Preferred terminal theme direction?
2. Weather API preferences?
3. Desired terminal command structure?
4. Additional features for globe interaction?

## Dependencies to Add

- Weather API client (to be determined)
- Geocoding service (to be determined)
- Animation libraries (if needed)

## Additional Notes

- Keep responsive design in mind for all new features
- Maintain modular component structure
- Focus on performance optimization
- Consider accessibility features
